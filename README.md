<p></p> 👋 Hey! I’m Queenie from the uk 🇬🇧 
<p></p>  👀 I am interested in coding as I used to create my webpage for my myspace page during my teenhood days, where I thoroughly enjoyed developing the look and feel for it.
<p></p>  🎨 I love creating on and offline due to being born with busy hands and a restless mind!
<p></p>  🌱 Currently I am learning the Basics with SheCodes.
<p></p>  🤝 I Look to collaborate on anything and everything relating to front end development or UX/UI design.
<p></p>  📫 How to reach me: queenie_secker@hotmail.co.uk
<p></p>  My website is coming soon, to a page near you! 💞
